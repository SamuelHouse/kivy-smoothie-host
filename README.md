# kivy-smoothie-host
A Smoothie host, written in Kivy for running on rpi with touch screen.

This is a work in progress

This uses python >= 3.4.3

## install
I use kivypi from here  http://kivypie.mitako.eu/ and the official 7" touch screen

You need the latest python serial and pyserial-asyncio from here https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial-asyncio.git

Run with...

> kivy main.py

### On linux (and maybe windows/macos)

Install kivy for python3 from your distro

Run as

> python3 main.py

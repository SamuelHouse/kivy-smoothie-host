This is a quick description of one way to center your gcode on a workpiece...

1. Position tool over bottom left corner of workpiece set XY to zero
2. Position tool over top right corner of workpiece and set half
     * if using a pendant there is a button to set half
     * or in the DRO WPOS window type /2 in the X then the Y input boxes
3. Move to 0,0 (G0 X0Y0), again the pendant has a button for this. This will move the tool to the exact center of the workpiece
4. bring up the viewer with the gcode you plan to run
5. click the Select button and move the cross hairs over the center of extents marker (a small red circle and cross)
6. click the set WPOS button

You have now centered the gcode over the work piece.
